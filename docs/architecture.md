# Architectural Overview of Global Harmony Nexus Core

## Introduction

The Global Harmony Nexus Core is a decentralized platform designed to facilitate collaboration and governance in various projects. The architecture is built on a microservices model, leveraging blockchain technology for transparency and security.

## Components

### 1. Frontend

- **Framework**: React.js
- **Purpose**: Provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the platform.
- **Key Features**:
  - User authentication
  - Proposal creation and voting
  - Dashboard for users to view their activities

### 2. Backend

- **Framework**: Node.js with Express
- **Purpose**: Handles business logic, user management, and API endpoints.
- **Key Features**:
  - RESTful API for frontend communication
  - User authentication and authorization
  - Proposal management

### 3. Smart Contracts

- **Platform**: Ethereum (or any other blockchain)
- **Purpose**: Implements governance and fund distribution logic.
- **Key Contracts**:
  - **Governance Contract**: Manages proposals and voting.
  - **Fund Distribution Contract**: Handles the distribution of funds based on proposals.
  - **Token Contract**: Manages the native token used within the platform.

## Data Flow

1. Users interact with the frontend application.
2. The frontend communicates with the backend via RESTful API calls.
3. The backend processes requests, interacts with the database, and communicates with smart contracts on the blockchain.
4. Smart contracts execute logic and return results to the backend, which then sends responses back to the frontend.

## Conclusion

The architecture of the Global Harmony Nexus Core is designed to be modular, scalable, and secure, ensuring a seamless experience for users while maintaining the integrity of the platform.
